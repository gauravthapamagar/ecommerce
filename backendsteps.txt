create server.js (this will be the main file of the backend server)
    here npm init -y    
install bcrypt to encrypt the password 
install cloudinary to upload files to the cloud
install cookie-parser to send authentication to server 
install cors (it helps to connect backend with the frontend)
install dotenv
install express
install jsonwebtokens (it will create tokens to authenticate the users)
install mongoose (it helps to connect backend with the database)
install multer (using this we can upload the images)
install stripe/khalti to use the online payment gateway
after that install nodemon in the development server only ( this helps such that whenever we make changes it will restart server)
